# Gold-Badge-Challenges 
This Repo contains 3 seperate challenges; Komodo Cafe, Komodo Claims, and Komodo Badges. 
The Komodo Cafe challenge is a simply food menu, which allows the user to create, delete, and read items on a fast food menu.
The Komodo Claims challenge allows the user to their claims, add new claims, and "take care of"/delete claims from their list.
The Komodo Badges challenge allows the user to see all badges and the doors they have access to, as well as update those badges to change their clearance, and then add/create new badges.
